EXAMPLE OF QUERY :what did piero cipollone say about digital euro in 2025Here’s a summary of what Piero Cipollone has said in 2025 about the digital euro — what he supports, what risks he sees, and what things are still undecided.
Key points Cipollone has made in 2025:
Profitability / Cost & Financial StabilityCipollone told EU Parliamentarians that the digital euro is unlikely to be loss‑making. He said that from what is known, uptake (how many people use it) won't be so large as to threaten financial stability. But he also emphasized that the assumption that it will be profitable needs to be proven, and that part of the plan is a compensation model: payment service providers (banks, etc.) would get compensated for their costs to set up/distribute the digital euro. He argues that Europe currently depends heavily on non‑European private payment providers (Visa, Mastercard, etc.) for digital payments, which raises concerns about sovereignty, resilience, and data. A digital euro would help reduce that dependency. He has spoken of the digital euro as a tool to preserve Europe’s ability to pay using public money, even when cash is less used. Cipollone has made it clear that even with a digital euro, cash will continue to exist. The goal is complementarity — digital euro is meant to do what cash cannot (especially in digital/online settings), but cash remains a fundamental freedom for users. He has emphasized that the digital euro should function like cash in important respects: legal tender, wide acceptance, public availability, etc. He sees the digital euro as a fallback or safety net in major disruptions (e.g. cyber‑attacks or outages) and aims for it to work even offline (or in scenarios where usual digital infrastructure might fail). Inclusion is another theme: ensuring all citizens have access to a digital form of public money, even those without private bank accounts, or in places where cash is harder to use. He has stated that the framework (i.e. the legal/regulatory side) still needs to be agreed by EU member states and the European Parliament, and that this is one of the key remaining hurdles. He has hoped for a political agreement on the digital euro by early 2026, after which launching it might take an additional 2‑3 years. Things still uncertain / risks he underlinesExactly how much usage the digital euro will get, and whether that usage will generate enough value to cover costs (for infrastructure, distribution, etc.). The profitability is not assumed, but hoped for. How to balance between ensuring privacy, resilience (including offline operations), cost, and legal/regulatory compliance (anti‑money laundering, etc.). These trade‑offs are still being worked out. The potential impact on the banking sector: for example, if people shift deposits from private banks into a digital euro, or reduce use of banks’ digital payment services, how that might affect banks’ business models. He acknowledges these are concerns.
